# Princeton Discord Bot

Currently, this is a PoC that is not fully fleshed out.

There are three main components involved in the data flow

- parsing from Princeton websites
- storing parsed data
- manipulating stored data and presenting it via Discord (note, this can be presented in other forms)

## Future

If this project is to be maintained, we need to expand upon the current structure and add parsing capabilities for new sites, store more data (and maybe in another format - not JSON), and increase bot functionality.

If this is developed, we can also add Discord authentication via Princeton email addresses (which would be cool)
